In this repository you can find the code used to generate my personal web page (in
English): <https://felipe-gonzalez.com/>

The web was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). You can find
more info on how to create a blog with Quarto in the
[documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).

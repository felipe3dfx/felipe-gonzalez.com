I am the **CTO** of [Axiacore](https://axiacore.com) with **10 years** of experience as a **Multimedia Engineer** in web development. I have worked as a **backend developer** for various tech companies, including my current position as **CTO**. I am **passionate** about technology and eager to share my knowledge.

After studying [Multimedia Engineering](https://www.umng.edu.co/programas/pregrados/ingenieria-multimedia) at university, I worked on the **RAIM project** and then became a backend developer in marketing agencies. I joined [Axiacore](https://axiacore.com) in 2016 and became **CTO** in 2018. I am **results-oriented, decisive, and direct**. I take risks and have excellent problem-solving skills.

As a **team-oriented** individual, I believe in taking on new challenges and working collaboratively to overcome them. While I excel in technical tasks, I understand the importance of leveraging the strengths of each team member to achieve success.
